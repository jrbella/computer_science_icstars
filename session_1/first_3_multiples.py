# Write your first_three_multiples function here:

def first_three_multiples(num):
	return num * 3

# Uncomment these function calls to test your first_three_multiples function:
first_three_multiples(10)
# should print 10, 20, 30, and return 30
#first_three_multiples(0)
# should print 0, 0, 0, and return 0
