# Write your average function here:
def average(num1, num2):
    sum(num1) + sum(num2) / length(num1)
  result = (num1 + num2)/2
  return result
# Uncomment these function calls to test your average function:
print(average(1, 100))
# The average of 1 and 100 is 50.5
print(average(1, -1))
# The average of 1 and -1 is 0
